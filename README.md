# IE0005-Predicting-Cardiovascular-Disease-with-AI
# Comparing the accuracy of simple learners against a stacked ensemble learner

## Description:
Through this project, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of single learners against a stacked ensemble learner with the aforementioned single learners as our Level 0 models


The dataset we will be using can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

## Contents:
Our notebook will be split into 3 parts. 

> **Part 1** covers the explaratory data analysis done on this dataset, as well as the Data Cleaning we have performed.

> **Part 2** covers the various Level 0 models we will be using to evaluate our meta-model

> **Part 3** covers the accuracy metrics for the individual Level 0 models

> **Part 4** concerns the construction and evaluation of our meta-model

> **Part 5** contains an overview on the different models we have examined.

> **Appendix** contains the code for running each model 1000 times to obtain average results.

## Models Used:

**Level 0 Models:** 
> Decision Tree (2.1)
> Logistic Regression (2.2)
> Naive Bayes (2.3)
> MultiLayer Perceptron (2.4)

**Level 1 Model**
>MultiLayer Perceptron
